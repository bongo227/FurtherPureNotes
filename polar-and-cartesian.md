# Polar and cartesian
A polar coordinate is and angle $$\theta$$ and a length $$r$$ written in the form $$(\theta, r)$$. To draw a polar coordinate start from $$OL$$, the initial line, rotate by the value of $$\theta$$ and draw a line of length $$r$$.

The value of $$\theta$$ can either be bounded by $$0 \leq \theta < 2\pi$$ or $$-\pi < \theta \leq \pi$$.

Using simple trigonometry we can derive a simple relationship between polar and cartesian coordinates.
$$
x = r \cos \theta, \quad y = r \sin \theta\\
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \quad \tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}
